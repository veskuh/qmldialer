Introduction
============

The follow list are features still to be implimented in the dialer application.

Each entry has the fields:
- <brief description>
  Details:    As much info as is needed to understand the purpose, complexity,
              impact and dependancies of the feature.  The goal being to allow
              those interested in helping to determine if they have the
              knowledge and time to do so.
  Priority:   An indicator of the project perceived urgency for implementation.
              Values are: Low, Medium, High
  Complexity: A estimate of the difficulty to implement or potential impact to
              the rest of the project.
              Values are: C1, C2, C4 and C8 (See "What is Complexity?" below)
  BMC#:       Bugzilla id from bugs.meego.com (optional, but recomended)

What is Complexity?
==================

First, I am borrowing this from the Ofono project, so if you are familiar
with how they use it, it is the same here.

Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.

The complexity scale is exponential, with complexity 1 being the lowest
complexity.  Complexity is a function of both task 'complexity' and task
'scope'.

The general rule of thumb is that a complexity 1 task should take 1-2 weeks
for a person very familiar with oFono codebase.  Higher complexity tasks
require more time and have higher uncertainty.

Higher complexity tasks should be refined into several lower complexity tasks
once the task is better understood.

  Owner:        Shane Bryan <shane.bryan@linux.intel.com>

                NOTE: Depends on Audio routing integration
  Priority:     High
  Complexity:   C2
  BMC#:         BMC#2809
  Owner:

  Details:      
  Priority:     Medium
  Complexity:   C1
  BMC#:         BMC#2794
  Owner:        

- Explicit Call Transfer
  Details:      
  Priority:     Medium
  Complexity:   C1
  BMC#:         BMC#2803
  Owner:        

- Private Conversation during multi-party call
  Details:      
  Priority:     Low
  Complexity:   C4
  BMC#:         BMC#2807
  Owner:

  BMC#:         BMC#2808
  Owner:        

- Auto redial / Call Completion to Busy Subscriber
  Details:      
  Priority:     Medium
  Complexity:   C2
  BMC#:         BMC#2804
  Owner:

  Details:      
  Priority:     Low
  Complexity:   
  BMC#:         
  Owner:        

System Interaction tasks
------------------------

- Ringtones associated per contact
  Details:      Should be able to set/get a ringtone for each contact.  This
                is mostly a requirement on libseaside, but dialer will need to
                determine if, for an incoming call, the contact associated with
                the lineid has a ringtone preference set, and use it instead of
                and defaults if so
  Priority:     Medium
  Complexity:   C4
  BMC#:         BMC#2661
  Owner:        

- Call settings UI
  Details:      A settings plugin for letting the user see (and change
                when allowed) the various dialer and ofono settings
  Priority:     High
  Complexity:   C2
  BMC#:         
  Owner:        


Misc other tasks
----------------

- Migrate to using libofono-qt
  Details:      With the maturing of libofono-qt, we need to standardize
                upon it's API rather than our own local introspected XML
                interface proxies.
  Priority:     High
  Complexity:   C1
  BMC#:         BMC#18701
  Owner:        Shane Bryan <shane.bryan@linux.intel.com>

- Refactor debug output
  Details:      The debugging output of dialer is crude, simplistic and
                prone to inconsistent use by different contributors.
                We need a filterable and formalized set of debugging
                functions/macros that make this simple to use as both
                a developer writing new code, and dev/QA/user trying to
                root cause an issue or understand how dialer works
  Priority:     High
  Complexity:   C1
  BMC#:         
  Owner:
