fc21 Switch to model/view for managing call items. Allow a call to be made as long as there is only one active call, or all the active calls are part of the active multiparty call. Unlimited calls can be made and combined with the model/view approach. Display the numpad if hidden when the last call is disconnected. Fixed problem with hold button image changing incorrectly when view is scrolled. Fixed problem with active call sometimes getting disconnected when trying to hangup the dialing call. Use two separate call views for dialing and incoming and create/destroy them appropriately using a Loader.
